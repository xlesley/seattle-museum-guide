# The Seattle Museums Guide

This is a project for the University of Washington Cooperative Software Development course (INFO 442).

The Seattle Museums Guide seeks to act as a comprehensive website designed to serve as a companion for exploring Seattle's museums for visitors and locals. It works for museum-goers by consolidating a range of information about Seattle's different cultural institutions into one site - including information about pricing, location, hours, discounts, descriptions, and special events. The customer base for Seattle Museums Guide includes a range of individuals with various needs and interests. It is primarily designed to serve tourists visiting Seattle by providing a curation of the city's most prominent cultural institutions. With the information made accessible through the Seattle Museums Guide, visitors can make decisions based on their interests - whether they are art lovers, history buffs, or science nerds. On the other end, Seattle Museums Guide seeks to attract Seattle residents and locals looking to engage with previously unfamiliar cultural experiences and institutions within their city. Seattle Museums Guide appeals to families and educational institutions seeking educational and enriching activities for children and students. By offering a comprehensive overview of the exhibits and programs available at various museums, parents and educators can easily identify age-appropriate and curriculum-relevant experiences.
